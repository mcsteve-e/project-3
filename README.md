Python hashmap

# Algorithm 1 
(the first hashing method):

    Add the ord of the first and last letters of the key, multiply by 79 and return mod the size of the arrays.


# Algorithm 2
(the rehashing method):

    Go through the key and add the ord of each letter, multiplied by 31.  Then return that sum mod the size of the arrays.
